				<h2>A Few Words Concerning Insurance</h2>
				<p>Truvize believes that insurance is an important part of a sound financial plan, but too often, it is oversold. Insurance is a solution, not the only solution.</p>
				<p>We have seen countless examples of insurance products being sold for the benefit of the agent and not in the best interest of the client.</p>
				<p>We have put into place several safeguards to ensure that our insurance recommendations are in the best interest of our clients.</p>
				
				<ul class="few-words">
					<li>We use a detailed analysis based on your entire financial picture to determine your insurance need.<li>
					<li>We are completely independent.<br/>
					This means that we do not work directly for a carrier instead we work for you identifying the best company that fits your insurance need.</li>
					<li>Insurance products are arguably the most complex financial products available.<br/>
					We structure each policy to benefit the client, not Truvize.</li>
					<li>MOST importantly we have complete transparency in regards to any commission we receive.</li>

						<h3>What is a Fiduciary?</h3>
						<br><br>
						<h4>Learn more</h4>
									
						<p>Most clients do not know the difference between a fiduciary standard and a sustainability standard. Truvize operates under a fiduciary standard.</p>
						<p>A fiduciary has a legal and ethical obligation to put the other party's interests above their own. For a financial planner/advisor, that means helping a client make decision in his/her best interest, even if it means reduced compensation - or no compensation - for the advisor.</p>
						<p>Under a suitability standard the advisor is only required to recommend products and investments that are "suitable" and may not be in the best interest of the client. Every client should ask their advisor if they a operating as their fiduciary.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-tile"> 
						<h3>What is your investment philosophy?</h3>
						
						<h4>Learn more</h4>
								
						<p>We believe history has shown that a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio based on a client’s risk tolerance gives you the best chance of success. </p>
						<p>Active management and individual stock picking bring higher expenses, more transaction costs, and higher taxes, all of which can hurt a portfolio significantly in the long run.</p>
						<p>Using some of the most robust risk planning software available, we work with our clients to decide on an allocation that fits their desire, willingness and need to take the risk and build a portfolio accordingly.</p>
						<p>Once a portfolio is set we monitor it daily, rebalancing when needed, to ensure the client's <a href="https://vimeo.com/188361232">risk score</a> matches their allocation.<br/></p>
